# Rocket Academy  
**Learn. Design. Launch.**  

Rocket Academy is an interactive web platform that teaches students how **model rockets work**, guides them through **building their own designs**, and lets them **simulate launches with AIâ€‘powered feedback** â€” all in one place.  

This project was created to make rocketry **fun, accessible, and interactive** for middle school and high school students.

## Features  

### **1. Interactive Learning Modules**  
- **Preview Quiz:** See what you already know before you start.  
- **Tailored Lessons:** Lessons on rocketry fundamentals like forces, flight dynamics, and rocket components. *(Planned: AIâ€‘driven personalization based on your preâ€‘quiz results.)*  
- **Postâ€‘Learning Quiz:** Check your progress and see how much youâ€™ve improved.  
- **Progress Tracking:** Track which lessons and modules youâ€™ve completed.  

### **2. Dragâ€‘andâ€‘Drop Rocket Workshop**  
- Build rockets by dragging and dropping parts like nose cones, tubes, fins, and engines.  
- **Custom Part Builder (Planned):** Create your own rocket parts with defined dimensions, weight, and properties.  
- Save and organize your rocket designs with descriptions.  

### **3. Flight Simulation**  
- Launch your virtual rocket and view a **visualized flight path**.  
- **Realâ€‘time data:** Track altitude, velocity, thrustâ€‘toâ€‘weight ratio, and more.  
- **Graph outputs:** Altitude vs. time and velocity vs. time.  
- **Planned:** Parachute recovery simulation for more realistic flights.  

### **4. AIâ€‘Powered Rocket Coach**  
- Get **personalized feedback** on your rocket design.  
- Compare different designs and see how to improve performance.  
- Receive **specific part recommendations** (e.g., switch to a lighter nose cone, use a higherâ€‘thrust engine).  
- **Ask custom questions** directly to the AI coach for tailored advice.

## Why Rocket Academy?  
Learning model rocketry online can be overwhelming. Many available resources are outdated, difficult to navigate, or too technical for beginners.  
Rocket Academy simplifies this by:  
- **Breaking down complex concepts** into studentâ€‘friendly lessons.  
- **Providing instant feedback** using AI.  
- **Combining design + simulation** so you can see how your rocket would perform before building it in real life.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python  
- **Simulation Engine:** Custom simplified physics model  
- **AI Tools:** ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other LLMâ€‘powered agents for lesson generation and feedback  
- **Database:** TBD  

---

## Roadmap  
- [ ] Expand lesson library (beginner â†’ advanced concepts).  
- [ ] Add AIâ€‘powered custom part generation.  
- [ ] Improve flight simulation accuracy (realâ€‘world drag coefficients, mass properties).  
- [ ] Add parachute recovery and staging simulation.  
- [ ] Refine AI analysis for deeper performance insights.

## Vision  
Rocket Academy aims to **make rocketry education approachable** for all students â€” whether youâ€™ve never built a rocket before or want to test advanced designs.  

By combining **interactive lessons**, **handsâ€‘on design tools**, and **AIâ€‘powered coaching**, we help learners go from **understanding the basics** to **designing their own highâ€‘performing rockets** â€” all without the cost or risk of realâ€‘world trial and error.
