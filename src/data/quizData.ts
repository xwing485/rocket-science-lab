    question: 'What force pushes a rocket upward?',
    options: [
      'Gravity',
      'Thrust',
      'Drag',
      'Wind'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Thrust is the force created by burning fuel that pushes the rocket upward, opposing gravity.'

    question: 'Which law explains how rockets work?',
    options: [
      'Newton\'s First Law',
      'Newton\'s Second Law', 
      'Newton\'s Third Law',
      'Law of Gravity'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Newton\'s Third Law states "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction" - this is how rockets create thrust.'

    question: 'What part of a rocket helps it fly straight?',
    options: [
      'Nose cone',
      'Body tube',
      'Engine',
      'Fins'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Fins provide stability and help keep the rocket flying straight by preventing it from tumbling.'

    question: 'For a rocket to lift off, thrust must be:',
    options: [
      'Equal to weight',
      'Less than weight',
      'Greater than weight',
      'Independent of weight'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Thrust must be greater than the rocket\'s weight (gravity) for it to overcome gravity and lift off.'

    question: 'What happens when hot gases shoot out the bottom of a rocket?',
    options: [
      'The rocket gets heavier',
      'An equal force pushes the rocket up',
      'The rocket slows down',
      'Nothing happens to the rocket'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'According to Newton\'s Third Law, when gases push down, an equal and opposite force pushes the rocket up.'

    question: 'Which rocket part reduces air resistance?',
    options: [
      'Fins',
      'Engine',
      'Nose cone',
      'Recovery system'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The pointed nose cone cuts through the air smoothly, reducing drag (air resistance).'

    question: 'What force always pulls rockets toward Earth?',
    options: [
      'Thrust',
      'Drag',
      'Gravity',
      'Lift'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Gravity is the force that always pulls objects, including rockets, toward Earth\'s surface.'
  },
  {
    id: 'post-5',
    question: 'Why do rockets need fins?',
    options: [
      'To make them look cool',
      'To create more thrust',
      'To provide stability and prevent tumbling',
      'To reduce weight'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Fins act like the feathers on an arrow - they provide stability and keep the rocket pointing in the right direction.'
